# Maze-Solving AI Agent ðŸ§©

Welcome to the **Maze-Solving AI Agent** project! This Python-based project implements intelligent agents that solve mazes using search algorithms like **A*** and **BFS**. The agent navigates from the bottom-right corner to the top-left corner, with visualization powered by `pyamaze`.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates maze solving using informed and uninformed search algorithms. The implementation features:
- **A*** algorithm with Manhattan distance heuristic
- **BFS** (Breadth-First Search) for guaranteed shortest paths
- Dynamic maze generation with customizable loops
- Path visualization with step-by-step animation
- Performance metrics including execution time and nodes explored

---

## Features
- **Search Algorithms**:  
  - **A***: Optimized with Manhattan distance heuristic and priority queue  
  - **BFS**: Uninformed search using a standard queue, guaranteeing the shortest path  
- **Maze Generation**:  
  - Customizable grid sizes (up to 35x35)  
  - Adjustable loop percentage (0-100%)  
- **Visualization**:  
  - Real-time path tracing with `pyamaze`  
  - Path length comparison between algorithms  
  - Multiple paths visualized simultaneously (BFS in red, A* in blue)  
- **Performance Metrics**:  
  - Execution time for each algorithm  
  - Number of nodes explored  
  - Path length comparison

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adel-Shurrab/maze-solving-ai-agent.git
   cd maze-solving-ai-agent
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   ```bash
   pip install pyamaze
   ```

3. **Run the Agent**:  
   ```bash
   python code/main.py
   ```

## Usage

### Default Configuration:
- Generates a **20x20 maze** with **10% loops**
- Solves using both **BFS** and **A*** algorithms
- Displays solution paths with agent animation
- Prints performance metrics (time and nodes explored)

### Customization:
Edit `code/main.py` to modify:
- Maze dimensions:  
  ```python
  rows, cols = 20, 20  # Change to desired size
  ```
- Loop percentage:  
  ```python
  loopPercent = 10  # Adjust between 0 (no loops) and 100 (many loops)
  ```
- Visualization:  
  Uncomment/comment sections in `main.py` to enable/disable specific algorithms.

### Example Output:

=== Performance Metrics ===
BFS Time: 0.0019s | Nodes Explored: 1226
A* Time: 0.0064s | Nodes Explored: 1303

Path Lengths - BFS: 90 | A*: 90

## Performance Metrics
The project provides detailed performance metrics for each algorithm:
- **Execution Time**: Measures how long each algorithm takes to solve the maze.
- **Nodes Explored**: Counts the number of nodes explored during the search.
- **Path Length**: Compares the length of the paths found by BFS and A*.

### Example Output:
```plaintext
=== Performance Metrics ===
BFS Time: 0.0019s | Nodes Explored: 1226
A* Time: 0.0064s | Nodes Explored: 1303

Path Lengths - BFS: 90 | A*: 90
```
